GLOSSA COMPILER
===============

Glossa (Γλώσσα) is a greek pseudo-language. The glossa compiler takes glossa code and compiles it down to C89. It will hopefully be able to manage a C FFI (foreign function interface) for easy integration with C.
Note that this compiler is purely experimental/a toy and is writen with the sole purpose of practise.
